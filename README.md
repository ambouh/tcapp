# tcapp
Mobile application for Android Platform built with Kotlin

### DESCRIPTION
tcapp is a beginner's project on understanding mobile development on the Android Platform. As part of team Androidia of Koolspan, 
my implementations mostly focuses on UI. Thus, my goal was to familiarize myself with commonly used features in our development.

#### The tcapp accomplishes a contacts workflow: 
* user logs in > (on success) 
* sees the contact list view > (on click of a contact-item) 
* sees the contact details view displaying the contact-item's name, number, action icons (call, text)
